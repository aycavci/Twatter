This is a modification of Flaskr from the flask tutorial http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/

Once you've worked through the flask tut it should all make sense.
It's a handy framework that already has a lot of the functionality we need, so give it a look.

RUN INSTRUCTIONS:
  install python and flask
  Navigate to this root directory.

  For Linux and Mac:
    export FLASK_APP=flaskr
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run

  For Windows cmd, use set instead of export:
    set FLASK_APP=flaskr
    set FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run

  Youâ€™ll see output similar to this:
    * Serving Flask app "flaskr"
    * Environment: development
    * Debug mode: on
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    * Restarting with stat
    * Debugger is active!
    * Debugger PIN: 855-212-761

  Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
